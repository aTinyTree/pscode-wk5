// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

	Num = Even if Num % 2 == 0
	Else Num = Odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   

	Read num1 , num2 , num3 , num4 , num5


b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

	avg = (num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5) / 5
	Print "the average of the numbers is"
	Print avg

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

	small = num1 
	for each element in array
		if ( element < small )
		small = element
	Print "the smallest number is"
	Print small

	large = num1
	for each element in array
		if ( element > large )
		large = element
	Print "the largest number is"
	Print large
	
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
